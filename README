== Facebook iframe canvas app

my experiments with iframe canvas apps for facebook

rails 239
facebooker gem http://github.com/mmangino/facebooker

- asks for permissions
- gets info about current user (+shows name and profile pic)
- lists his friends
- allows to publish status updates

todo:

- send invitations to the app (xfbml?)
- save users to database
- send messages to saved users? maybe have a Page
